# Code Refactor - Accessibility Exercise 

## Added Accessibility 
In an effort to increase accessibilty I replaced many non-semantic elements with semantic elements to provide more clarity to both the browser and developer when reading the HTML code. 

## Heirarchy
I made sure content was organized in order of importance and then placement on the webpage.

## Alt-text
In the event images will not load, I added alt-text to display so users will get a feeling for what was meant to be there.
